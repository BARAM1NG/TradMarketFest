## 3. Sentiment Analysis

### Yesan Market

- Shows a prominent positive buzz effect around influencer Baek Jong-won, but there are also negative opinions related to infrastructure issues (e.g., building tenants).


### Daegu Seomun Market

- While it hosts the "Chimaek Festival," there is insufficient buzz and mentions related to performances. The absence of fixed content highlights the lack of promotional impact for the traditional market.

# Conclusion

### Yesan Market
Yesan Market effectively increases visitor influx and stay duration through YouTube-based marketing. However, fundamental improvements in infrastructure and the local area are needed, as indicated by transportation mode analysis and keyword analysis, to enhance positive factors.

### Daegu Seomun Market
Seomun Market, while relatively accessible and not significantly lagging behind in overall interest compared to Yesan Market, does not sustain positive effects from its festivals over the long term. Improvements are needed in areas such as hygiene to address existing concerns.
